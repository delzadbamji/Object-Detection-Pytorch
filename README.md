# Object-Detection-Pytorch

This project helps detect objects from their given coordinates.

The coordinate system is (x,y,width, height).

The ground-truth is also provided to train the model and test the accuracy of the model.

The overlap score obtained through this implementation is 0.547.

Some of the results obtained are as follows:
